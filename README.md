## 👩‍💻 My Focus:
With a foundation in data science, I have delved into the realms of Python, SQL, and related technologies. My fascination with artificial intelligence has led me to experiment with libraries like `scikit-learn` initially but with great enthusiasm to explore other technologies.

## 🌐 Current Skills:
So far, I have worked on projects using tools like `Python` and `Scikit-Learn`, and I have explored data analysis with `Tableau` and `PowerBI`. While I am aware that my knowledge is still in development, I am excited about the prospect of delving deeper.

## 🤓 Continuous Learning:
I am committed to continuous learning and am exploring additional areas such as `TensorFlow` and `MongoDB`. While I am at the beginning of my journey, I am eager to tackle more complex challenges and expand my skills.

## 🚀 Main Projects:
1. Project One: [https://github.com/ASGuzman/PI_MLOps_Steam]
2. Project Two: [https://github.com/ASGuzman/ProyectoIntegradorM6]
3. Project Three: [https://github.com/ASGuzman/PI2_Siniestros_Viales]

I am excited to continue exploring and learning on this thrilling technological journey! Let's connect to share knowledge and explore new possibilities. 🌟
