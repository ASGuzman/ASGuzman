## 👩‍💻 My Focus:
With a foundation in data science, I have delved into the realms of Python, SQL, and related technologies. My fascination with artificial intelligence has led me to experiment with libraries like `scikit-learn` initially but with great enthusiasm to explore other technologies.

## 🌐 Current Skills:
So far, I have worked on projects using tools like `Python` and `Scikit-Learn`, and I have explored data analysis with `Tableau` and `PowerBI`. While I am aware that my knowledge is still in development, I am excited about the prospect of delving deeper.

## 🚀 Main Projects:
